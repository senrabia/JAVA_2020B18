Exceptions: unexpected or unwanted events

    there two types of exception:
            unchecked (unexpected event): occures during run time
                RuntimeException class is the parent of all exceptions
            checked (unwanted events): occurs during the compile time. needs to be handled IMMEDIATELY
exception handling:
    try & catch: blocks, used for handling the exception
            try{
                exception statements/code
            }catch(ExceptionClass  VariableName){
            }
            printStackTrace(): prints the stack trace of exception
            getMessage(): discription of exception
            try{
            }catch(){
            }catch(){
            }
            ...
            mulit-catch block: parent exception class CAN NOT be placed before its child exception
finally: always gets executed regardless of the exception
