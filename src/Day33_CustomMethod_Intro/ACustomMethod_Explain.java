package name: day33_CustomClass
        1. write a program that can return the unique objects from a anArray List of Integers
        Ex:
        list: {1,1,2,3,4,5,5}
        sout(list); ==> {2,3,4};
        Note: 1. DO NOT use any extra arrayList
        2. DO NOT use any loops
        3. do not use any sort method
        4. use predicate only and collections methods only
        Hint:   Collections.frequency() // will return the frequency
        removeIf( frequency == 1)  can keep the unique objects in arrayList
        2. write a program that can return the duplicated objects from a an ArrayList of Integers
        Ex:
        list: {1,1,2,3,4,5,5}
        sout(list); ==> {1,1,5,5};
        Note: 1. DO NOT use any extra arrayList
        2. DO NOT use any loops
        3. DO NOT use any sort method
        4. Use predicate and collections methods only
        3. write a program that can extract the sepecial characters, digits and letters from a string and stores them into seperate ArrayLists of Character:
        ex:
        str = "ABCD123$%#@&456EFG!";
        list1: {$, %, #, @, &, !}
        list2: {A, B, C, D, E, F, G}
        list3: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
        DO NOT USE LAMBDA
        4. write a program that can extract the sepecial characters, digits and alphebets from a string and stores them into seperate ArrayLists of Character:

        DO NOT USE LOOPS
        Custom lass:
        String class:
        data/attribute:
        text, index
        actions/function:
        toLower(),toUpper()..
        car class:
        data/Attribute:
        brand, model, year, color, mileage...
        actions/functions:
        driver(), stop() ....
        objects: came from class, we can create multiple objects from a class

        ArrayList<>  list     =  new ArrayList<>();
        Class     refName               OBJECT
        Car car1 = new Car();
        Ex:
        car1 ==> BMW
        car2 ==> Toyota
        car3 ==> Audi
        class: where the objects came from , determines how the object should behave
        instance variables: object variables

        each object has its own copy of instance variable
        decleared outside the blocks or methods
        instance methods: object methods

        does not have static specifier
        local variable: variables that are declared within a block    */
