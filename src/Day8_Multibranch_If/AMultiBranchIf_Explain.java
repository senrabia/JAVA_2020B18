warmup tasks:
    1.  write a program that can check the equality of the three given numberrs
            declare 3 numbers n1, n2, n3
            if n1 and n2 are equal  => n1&n2 are equal
            if n2 and n3 are equal ==> n2&n3 are equal
            if n3 and n1 are qual ==>n3&n1 are equal
            if all equal ==> all equal
            if none of them are euqal ==> none of them are equal
    2. write a program that can find the number of days in a month
        (Assume that Feb has 28 days)
            byte month =  3
            28 days: 2
            30 days: 4,6,9,11
            31 days: 1,3,5,7,8,10,12
Multi branch if statement (else if) : if there are more than two possibilities, or option
            if(Condition1){
                    statement1;  // gets executed if condition1 is true
            } else if(condition2){
                    sattement2; // gets executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
            } else {  // other wise
                    statement3;  // gtes executed if all condition1 & 2 are failed
            }
    ONLY ONE OF THE BLOCK GETS EXECUTED
